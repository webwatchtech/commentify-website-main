                    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
                    <p>Information we collect falls into one of two categories: “voluntarily provided” information and
                        “automatically collected” information.</p>
                    <p>“Voluntarily provided” information refers to any information you knowingly and actively provide
                        us when
                        using or participating in any of our services and promotions.</p>
                    <p>“Automatically collected” information refers to any information automatically sent by your
                        devices in
                        the course of accessing our products and services.</p>
                    <h4>Log Data</h4>
                    <p>When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the standard data provided by your
                        web
                        browser. It may include your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and
                        version, the
                        pages you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, and other details
                        about
                        your visit.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, if you encounter certain errors while using the site, we may automatically collect
                        data
                        about the error and the circumstances surrounding its occurrence. This data may include
                        technical
                        details about your device, what you were trying to do when the error happened, and other
                        technical
                        information relating to the problem. You may or may not receive notice of such errors, even in
                        the
                        moment they occur, that they have occurred, or what the nature of the error is.</p>
                    <p>Please be aware that while this information may not be personally identifying by itself, it may
                        be
                        possible to combine it with other data to personally identify individual persons.</p>

                    <h4>Do Not Track</h4>
                    <p>Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to
                        have
                        your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not respond to browser “Do Not Track”
                        signals.</p>
                    <p>We adhere to the standards outlined in this privacy policy, ensuring we collect and process
                        personal
                        information lawfully, fairly, transparently, and with legitimate, legal reasons for doing so.

                        incentives
                        permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels for the
                        goods or

                        Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may
                        revoke
                        at any time.</p>
